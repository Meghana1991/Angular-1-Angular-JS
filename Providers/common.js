1) Whenever any provider or (service or factory also) gets injected, then the provider gets saved and whenever accessed next would be picked from the place saved.So only one the call to the provider happens.

2) Main business logic should be in providers(provider or factory or service) as it is reused and singleton and invoked only once

/**
	Other than the first example mentioned above about returning the VALUE in factory, there is no other difference technically. However, there is main difference usage wise and when to use what?

	Assume a  bmw car company present. I want to use factory in a situation where i can create multiple objects based on the customer requirement like red blue yellow car objects. Factory are best suited for this purpose where you can have objects for these types.Usually thats what the object does in reality where it will have properties of some element(here el is car).So car properties are stored in object hence use a factory

			description : description,

				console.log("Details are - "+modelNo+" "+description+" "+modelNo);

/**
	Services are used when you have a set of common functionality which doesn't hold up much information or which needn't have any information(may be empty constructor) and all you use the service is just for similar or common functionlity to be present in multiple places.Like say the http calls.

	This shows how the CarService will always a produce a car with 4 cylinders, you can't change it for individual cars. Whereas bmwSpecification returns a function so you can do new bmwSpecification in your controller, passing in a number of cylinders specific to that car. You can't do new CarService because CarService is an object not a function.

	So service is like a template with common features and however you can add or customise them using factory.

	Service = These puppies get passed around regularly, ensuring that youâ€™re dealing with the same object each time, unlike factories.
