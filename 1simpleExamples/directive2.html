1) We use directive whenever we need to modify the HTML in the DOM 
2) Creating the directive for DOM manipulation is the best option eventhough we can do it with controllers etc

/**
1) in the above example, I have 2 divs and the result is same for both divs even though different names are passed. It is taking second directive call's name and outpt is 
NotmyText
NotmyText

2)Why compile?
Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking function.in the compilation phase a directive also has a chance to modify the DOM node before a scope is attached to it

Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. Making the scope model a single source of truth,in this phase AngularJS attaches event listeners to the HTML template to make it interactive and attaches a scope to the directive and it does that for each DOM node the directive appears in; the linking phase takes place after the compilation of the whole HTML template has been executed; if the directive needs to access the scope, its link function allows that.
